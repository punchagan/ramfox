# Ramfox

A Firefox extension that sort of makes it behave like Rambox

## Why?

I like Rambox for some of the features it has (see planned features section
below), but it feels like the wheel is being re-invented, in [some
cases](https://github.com/saenzramiro/rambox/issues/509).

I'd like to use a standard browser, with some additional functionality.

## Planned features

- [ ] DND mode

    - [ ] Turn notifications on/off
    - [ ] Show/Hide unread counts

- [ ] Master password on Launch

- [ ] Master password at run-time (optional)

- [X] Open all links in the default browser

## Setup ##

### Mac OS/Linux setup ###

Just clone the repository, and run the script `run.py

### Windows setup ###

**NOTE**: Windows is not yet supported

## License

This extension is a fork of the [native messaging
example](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/native-messaging)
